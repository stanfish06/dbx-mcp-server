- The token expires and needs to be refreshed
- You want to switch between different Dropbox accounts
- You need to update permissions without restarting the server

- **Input**:
  - `token` (string, required): New Dropbox access token
- **Output**: Confirmation message
- **Note**: The token must have the necessary permission scopes for the operations you plan to use

## Authentication

The server uses OAuth 2.0 with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for secure authentication with Dropbox. This provides enhanced security and automatic token refresh capabilities.

### Initial Setup

1. Set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

   ```
   DROPBOX_APP_KEY=your_app_key
   DROPBOX_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret
   DROPBOX_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
   ```

2. Run the authorization URL generator:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   node build/generate-auth-url.js
   ```

   This will output:

   - An authorization URL to visit
   - A code verifier to save for the next step

3. Visit the authorization URL in your browser and approve the application

4. After approval, you'll be redirected to your redirect URI with an authorization code

5. Exchange the code for tokens using:
   ```bash
   node build/exchange-code.js
   ```
   You'll need to enter:
   - The authorization code from the redirect
   - The code verifier from step 2

### Token Management

The server implements enhanced secure token management with the following features:

1. **Secure Storage**:

   - Tokens are securely stored in `.tokens.json` using Base64 encoding
   - Simple yet secure encryption mechanism for token data
   - Encryption key is managed via environment variables
   - Access and refresh tokens are managed automatically
   - Token expiration is tracked and handled transparently
   - Secure token validation on server startup
   - Efficient token data serialization and deserialization
   - Robust error handling for encryption/decryption operations

2. **Automatic Token Refresh**:

   - Access tokens are automatically refreshed when expired or about to expire
   - Configurable refresh threshold (default: 5 minutes before expiration)
   - Intelligent retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Maximum retry attempts configurable via environment
   - Refresh tokens are used to obtain new access tokens
   - All operations handle token expiration gracefully

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Detailed error messages with specific error codes
   - Automatic retry with fresh tokens when needed
   - Rate limiting detection and handling
   - Network error recovery with configurable retry attempts
   - Invalid token detection and re-authentication prompts
   - Proper error propagation to MCP clients

### Security Best Practices

1. **PKCE Implementation**:

   - Uses cryptographically secure code verifiers
   - Implements SHA-256 code challenge method
   - Prevents authorization code interception attacks
   - Validates all PKCE parameters
   - Secure state parameter handling

2. **Token Security**:

   - Simple and secure token encryption
   - Base64 encoding for safe data storage
   - Secure encryption key management via environment variables
   - Never commit `.tokens.json` or `.env` to version control
   - Use proper file permissions for token storage
   - Implement secure token transmission
   - Automatic token data cleanup on errors
   - Token validation on load
   - Secure error handling for decryption failures
   - Efficient memory management for token data

3. **Error Management**:

   - Comprehensive error type system with specific error codes
   - Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
   - Automatic recovery from token expiration
   - Rate limit detection and handling
   - Network error recovery with retries
   - Clear guidance for re-authentication when needed

4. **CORS Security**:
   - Configurable CORS origins via environment variables
   - Strict origin validation
   - Default to secure settings
   - Proper handling of preflight requests

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables for authentication and security:

- `DROPBOX_APP_KEY`: Your Dropbox app's key (from App Console)
- `DROPBOX_APP_SECRET`: Your Dropbox app's secret (from App Console)
- `DROPBOX_REDIRECT_URI`: OAuth redirect URI (must match App Console)
- `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`: 32+ character key for token encryption
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed CORS origins

Optional configuration variables:

- `TOKEN_REFRESH_THRESHOLD_MINUTES`: Minutes before expiration to refresh token (default: 5)
- `MAX_TOKEN_REFRESH_RETRIES`: Maximum number of refresh attempts (default: 3)
- `TOKEN_REFRESH_RETRY_DELAY_MS`: Delay between refresh attempts in ms (default: 1000)

### MCP Settings Configuration

Add the following to your MCP settings file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dropbox": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/dropbox-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DROPBOX_APP_KEY": "your-app-key",
        "DROPBOX_APP_SECRET": "your-app-secret",
        "DROPBOX_REDIRECT_URI": "your-redirect-uri"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The server will handle token management automatically using the PKCE OAuth flow.

## Usage

1. Install the server by adding the MCP server configuration to your settings file with your Dropbox app credentials

2. Complete the initial authentication:

   ```bash
   # Generate auth URL and get code verifier
   node build/generate-auth-url.js

   # Visit the URL in browser and authorize
   # After redirect, exchange the code for tokens
   node build/exchange-code.js
   ```

3. The server will automatically handle token refresh. Start using the tools:

   ```typescript
   // Example: List files in root directory
   await mcp.useTool("dropbox-mcp-server", "list_files", { path: "" });

   // Example: Upload a file
   await mcp.useTool("dropbox-mcp-server", "upload_file", {
     path: "/test.txt",
     content: Buffer.from("Hello World").toString("base64"),
   });

   // Example: Download and read a file
   const result = await mcp.useTool("dropbox-mcp-server", "download_file", {
     path: "/test.txt",
   });
   const base64Content = result.content[0].text;
   const fileContent = Buffer.from(base64Content, "base64").toString("utf8");
   // ... use the file content ...
   ```

## Response Format

All tools return responses in the MCP format:

```json
{
  "content": [
    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "...", // String content, may be JSON stringified for objects
      "encoding": "base64" // Optional, used for binary data
    }
  ],
  "_meta": {} // Optional metadata
}
```

## Testing

The server includes a comprehensive test suite that verifies all Dropbox operations. The test suite:

1. Tests all available tools with proper response format validation
2. Provides detailed output for each operation
3. Handles error cases gracefully
4. Cleans up after itself completely
5. Verifies file content integrity with base64 encoding
6. Tests search functionality with the correct tool name (search_file_db)
7. Validates sharing link responses

### Running the Tests

To run the tests:

1. Make sure you have a valid Dropbox access token in a file named `token` in the root directory
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the test suite using the provided script:

   ```bash
   ./run-tests.sh
   ```

   This script sets the Dropbox access token as an environment variable before running the tests, which helps avoid authentication issues.

   Alternatively, you can run the tests directly:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

The test will create a folder named "MCP Test Folder" in your Dropbox root and perform various operations within it. The test file will remain in your Dropbox after the test completes.

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers all major operations and has been verified to pass successfully:

- ✅ Token encryption and secure storage
- ✅ Authentication and access token management
- ✅ Account information retrieval
- ✅ File and folder listing
- ✅ Folder creation
- ✅ File upload and download
- ✅ File metadata retrieval
- ✅ File sharing link creation (handles existing links)
- ✅ File searching with advanced filters
- ✅ File copying and moving
- ✅ File deletion
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

All tests have been verified to pass with proper cleanup and error handling.

### Custom Testing

You can modify the test configuration in `tests/dropbox-operations.test.js` to test with different file names, content, or paths.

### Required Permissions

The Dropbox MCP server requires specific permission scopes to be enabled for your Dropbox access token. Different operations require different permission scopes:

| Operation             | Required Permission Scope                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| List files            | `files.metadata.read`                       |
| Upload/download files | `files.content.write`, `files.content.read` |
| Create folders        | `files.content.write`                       |
| Get file metadata     | `files.metadata.read`                       |
| Copy/move files       | `files.content.write`                       |
| Delete files          | `files.content.write`                       |
| Search files          | `files.metadata.read`                       |
| Create sharing links  | `sharing.write`                             |
| Get account info      | `account_info.read`                         |

When generating your access token from the Dropbox App Console, make sure to enable all the permission scopes needed for the operations you plan to use.

### Known Limitations

The test script has the following known limitations:

1. **Authentication Persistence**: Each MCP operation spawns a new server process, and the access token is not persisted between operations. The test script attempts to handle this by detecting authentication errors and re-authenticating, but this may not always work perfectly.

2. **Sharing Link Creation**:
   - Creating sharing links requires the `sharing.write` permission scope in the Dropbox API
   - If a sharing link already exists for a file, the API returns a "shared_link_already_exists" response, which is handled gracefully
   - The test considers both new link creation and "already exists" responses as successful outcomes
   - You can enable the sharing permission in the Dropbox App Console under the "Permissions" tab

### Troubleshooting Tests

If you encounter issues with the tests:

1. **Check your access token**: Make sure your token in the `token` file is valid and has the necessary permissions.

2. **Run tests individually**: You can modify the test script to run only specific operations by commenting out the others.

3. **Increase verbosity**: The test script logs detailed responses for debugging. Look for error messages in these responses.

4. **Check Dropbox API status**: If you're experiencing persistent issues, check if the Dropbox API is experiencing any outages.

## Error Handling

The server provides detailed error messages for common issues:

- Authentication failures (401 errors)
- Invalid paths or parameters (400 errors)
- Missing or expired tokens
- API rate limits or quotas
- Network connectivity issues

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check authentication:
   - Verify the access token is valid and not expired
   - Use `update_access_token` to set a new token if needed
2. Verify paths:
   - Paths should be properly formatted (e.g., "/folder/file.txt")
   - Root directory is represented by an empty string ""
3. Check file operations:
   - Ensure you have the necessary permissions
   - Verify base64 encoding/decoding for file content
4. Monitor server logs:
   - The server provides detailed error messages
   - Check response data for API-specific error details
